# Fusion / DB2 catchup - 2021/07/09

## Box2

- what's the minimum that's useable for db2?
  - decryption only!

- BFE
  - binary field encoding
    https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/ssb-binary-field-encodings-spec
  - superset of TFK
    - mix: this looks exactly the same to me, can we please merge?

- extracted box2 lib
  - are you fine with replacing code in ssb-tribes with this?
    - mix: yes
    - mix: keen be involved in how to split is gone

- AGPL license
  - this makes it so everything above it has to be AGPL
  - mix: could be open to changing this, but would like to discuss more

- can we use DM key deterministically derived from somewhere?
  - e.g. from seed?
    - mix: where is seed stored?
    - arj: we encrypt it to a message on your log with box1
    - mix: I don't really want to be forced to use box1 to bootstrap box2
  - proposal
    - would like to have self-DM key derived from your sk + meta-feed seed
    - store the meta-feed seed in the `secret` file



## Fusion id

- review by justin + keks
  https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/ssb-meta-feed-spec/blob/master/meeting-notes-arj-keks-justin-2021-06-29
  
  - don't do signing in proof, rather demonstrate proof using a hash of (challenge+key)
    - mix: yes
  - password protect tombstoning
    - could implement an additional field on tombstone where you prove you knew a password which was bound to the identity earlier
    - nice extra
    - mix: yes
    
  - they were confused about the attestation part of the docs
    - should tidy it up
    
  - gonna have a review where they attack the spec
